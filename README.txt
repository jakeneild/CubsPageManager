Hello!

    Here I will explain the function of the program and it's use.  You can make a search query using a set news API
and it will return you a list of articles related to that query, sorted by most recent.  You can then post those articles
to the Nashville Chicago Cubs Fans group by pressing a button.  The post will include the title and description of the
article, and the url.

    Currently, the POSt request is returning me a 403 error.
